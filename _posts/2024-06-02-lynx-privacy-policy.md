Before using, you will need to read the privacy policy to understand where your data goes when using this bot. If you don't agree with any of these terms, please stop using the bot.

1. Blocklist System
- We have implemented a blocklist system via user ID. If a user generates inappropriate content or misuses the bot, they will be permanently blocked from using the bot. If the use of alternative or secondary accounts by a blocked user is detected, those accounts will also be blocked. We also have implemented a integration with the SpamWatch API to block banned users from there to use the bot. If you are banned from SpamWatch, you cannot use the bot.

2. Source Code
- If you wish to review the source code, please visit the Kowalski GitHub Repository (https://github.com/abocn/TelegramBot).

3. Terms Modification
- These terms may be changed or invalidated at any time, with or without prior notice.
