title: My most used domain finally died. (eleu.me)
description: I am poor. That's it.

On Jan 5 2024, my old domain eleu.me has finally expired since I don't have any money to mantain it anymore.

It doesn't work now since it is on Grace state for being a gTLD. If I don't renew it for the next 30 days, it will enter on Redemption mode and the domain will go to auction.

Well, if anyone wants to help, the full costs for renewing for 1 year will be $41.96 (259,54 BRL), so it is not cheap.

But yea, feel free to help at https://lucmsilva.com/#donate

Anyway, I not that sad for the eleu.me thing since I have the lucmsilva.com (thanks to one of my friends for that) and I picked up a new domain for free to one year which is lucmsilva.tech lmao

The issue is: eleu.me is on so many things and it will be hard to change everything to the new domains, so any help would be great and I would be grateful for that.
