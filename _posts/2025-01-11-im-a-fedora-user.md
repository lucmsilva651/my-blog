Heyyyy! I am now a Fedora user (again)! I have used Fedora several times with KDE, but I never liked it. Now, I have tried the normal Workstation version with Gnome and I assume that it is the best distros I have ever tested.

This is a screenshot of my desktop... Take a look!

I had a few problems with keyrings and stuff, but I just fixed it with Seahorse and now I don't see a problem with Fedora lmao.

And yes, I am not used to ``dnf`` or ``rpm``, but I think it will be easy to do so later on. Also, I am liking more to use Flathub.

I'm liking Fedora. That's it.

``` shell
echo "I love y'all guys!"
```
